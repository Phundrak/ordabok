#+title: Ordabok

* Introduction
Ordabok is a backend for multimedia dictionaries powered by its users.

* Compiling and running the project
This project requires an accessible PostgreSQL database (to store
pretty much all of the projectâ€™s data), an Appwrite instance (for
managing user accounts), and an S3 bucket (to store images, videos,
and audio). Copy ~.env.example~ with
#+begin_src shell
$ cp .env.example .env
#+end_src
and modify the ~.env~ file accordingly. You will also need to set the
variables for Appwrite and your S3 bucket.

Once this is done, execute the following command to run the backend.
#+begin_src shell
$ cargo run
# or
$ cargo run --release
#+end_src
